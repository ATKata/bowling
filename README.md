Uncle Bob's bowling kata

See http://content.codersdojo.org/code-kata-catalogue/bowling-game/ for the description we're working from.

It's a gradle build so should be easily importable to both Eclipse and IntelliJ.

The gradle wrapper is checked in too so you should be able to build and run the code from the command line with:
./gradlew build (*nix environments)
gradlew.bat build (DOS environments)

You can also run the eclipse and idea tasks to generate the artifacts required by your IDE or simply import the project directly if you have the right plugins installed.
